# Mystery Code Project

## Overview

The **Mystery Code Project** is no ordinary visual simulation. Crafted with care using Pygame, it features a hypnotic dance of particles—each pixel carefully choreographed to dazzle, intrigue, and perhaps even spark a bit of wonder.

But hidden beneath this visual spectacle lies a playful twist. This repository isn't just about exploring particle physics or advanced rendering techniques. It’s also an _indirect overture of charm_.

Are you curious yet?

## Access Rules

Before you proceed, there’s one crucial rule to keep in mind:

**If you don’t happen to be blessed with two XX chromosomes (yes, we’re talking to you, individuals with XY chromosomes—quick biology lesson: chromosomes are like the genetic instruction manual for humans. If you got an X and a Y, congrats, you’re probably a dude! If you got two X’s, you’re likely a lady, and this repository is especially for you), kindly (and with all due respect) close this repository and step away from the mystery. We promise, it’s not you, it’s us.**

Yes, you heard that right. This isn’t just a project. The author, a self-aware gentleman, has infused this repository with a touch of charm, intent, and perhaps a hope that it may brighten someone’s day.

Why such an unusual rule? Because every great mystery has its quirks. If this made you smile, you’ve already uncovered the first secret of the project.
